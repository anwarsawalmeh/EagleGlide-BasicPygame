# EagleGlide-BasicPygame
A game created in Pygame, based on the famous "Dinosaur Run" by Chrome

Learnt the fundamentals of Pygame through a tutorial in which a replica of the "Space Invaders" game was created,  
and based on that I made a game similar to "Dinosaur Game" by Chrome. 

The aim of this basic game is for the user to avoid hitting the trees, that are generated randomly by the program, with the distance between trees set randomly.
The game includes features such as ceilings and floors to avoid the character flying out of bounds,
in addition to increase in speed hence increasing the difficulty slightly.

Finally when the user hits a tree, a game over message is displayed until the user terminates the program.
